			<h2>About The Unjournal</h2>
			<p>
				<em>We are not a journal!</em>{" "}
				<a target="_blank" href="https://unjournal.org">
					<em>The Unjournal</em>
				</a>{" "}
				does not 'publish any papers'; we organize and fund public, journal-independent
				feedback, rating, and evaluation of hosted papers and dynamically presented research
				projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				Peer review is great, but conventional academic publication processes are wasteful,
				slow, and rent-extracting. They discourage innovation and prompt researchers to
				focus more on 'gaming the system' than on the quality of their research. We provide
				an immediate alternative and a bridge to a more efficient, informative, useful, and
				transparent research evaluation system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our evaluations and ratings are hosted{" "}
				<a href="https://unjournal.pubpub.org/" target="_blank">
					here on PubPub
				</a>
				, along with manager summaries, author responses, and links to the original
				research. Each evaluation and response is given a DOI and indexed by bibliometrics
				and academic search engines (such as Google Scholar).
			</p>
			<p>
				Our initial focus is quantitative work that informs global priorities, especially in
				economics, policy, and social science. We encourage better research by making it
				easier for researchers to get feedback and credible ratings on their work.
			</p>
