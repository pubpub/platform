# Rich Text Fields

- `RichText` fields are stored as html in the database. not as prosemirror trees anymore.
- The server only knows about html. it doesn't care about prosemirror.
- If you want to edit a field, you'll need a prosemirror tree. so, when you load the editor, the html gets converted to a ProseMirror tree on the client.
- Converting html to a ProseMirror tree is kind of slow, so if you want, you can do it on the server. but by default, it's done on the client, only when needed.
- Most clients (like the content api) just work with html. they never need to know about ProseMirror. only the main app really needs to care about ProseMirror, and only for editing.
- This makes it easier to display, export, or transform content, since html is the common format.
- If you want to create new content, you can just send html. the server will check that it converts to a valid ProseMirror tree, and if so, it'll store it as-is.
