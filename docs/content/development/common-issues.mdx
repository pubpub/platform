# Common issues

## Hard to explain "Foregin key constraints failed" errors

This might be a caching issue. Did you do a `pnpm reset` when the dev server was running?
Try quitting the dev server, running `pnpm --filter core clear-cache` and then restarting the dev server.

This should be a dev only error, although it might also appear when build previews are deployed (as `pnpm reset` is currently (March 25, 2025) run during the build).
