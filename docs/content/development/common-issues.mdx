# Issues you may run into

## Hard to explain "Foregin key constraints failed" errors

This might be a caching issue. Did you do a `pnpm reset` when the dev server was running?
Try quitting the dev server, running `pnpm --filter core clear-cache` and then restarting the dev server.

This should be a dev only error, although it might also appear when build previews are deployed (as `pnpm reset` is currently (March 25, 2025) run during the build).

## Typescript dev server keeps crashing

This might be due to extremely large types, but it's likely due to a bug in another VS Code extension or a bug in a Typescript extension.

### `next` typescript plugin

Most often, this is due to the `next` typescript plugin. Sadly, `next` does not want to disable auto adding this plugin to `core/tsconfig.json`, see https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/39942.

So either, we patch `next` to not do this, which can accomplished by doing something like this

```diff filename=node_modules/.pnpm/next@.../node_modules/next/dist/lib/typescript/writeConfigurationDefaults.js:314

      if (suggestedActions.length < 1 && requiredActions.length < 1) {
          return;
      }
-     await _fs.promises.writeFile(tsConfigPath, _commentjson.stringify(userTsConfig, null, 2) + _os.default.EOL);
+    // await _fs.promises.writeFile(tsConfigPath, _commentjson.stringify(userTsConfig, null, 2) + _os.default.EOL);
      _log.info('');
      if (isFirstTimeSetup) {
          _log.info(`We detected TypeScript in your project and created a ${(0, _picocolors.cyan)('tsconfig.json')} file for you.`);
```

You might also need to do the same in `node_modules/.pnpm/next@.../node_modules/next/dist/esm/lib/typescript/writeConfigurationDefaults.js` (the ESM version).

Another solution is to use the VS Code version of Typescript rather than the workspace version. Do `CMD + SHIFT + P` and then `> Typescript: Select TypeScript version` and then select `Use VS Code Version`. Make sure they are both using the same version.

### Rogue VS Code extensions

Some common VS Code extensions can also cause issues.

Ones I've observed to cause issues are:

- Astro plugin
- `better-ts-errors`

### `dispatcher.getOwner is not a function`

If you see something like

```
TypeError: dispatcher.getOwner is not a function
    at getOwner (/node_modules/.pnpm/react@19.1.1/node_modules/react/cjs/react.development.js:162:54)
    at process.env.NODE_ENV.exports.createElement (/node_modules/.pnpm/react@19.1.1/node_modules/react/cjs/react.development.js:1031:9)
    at Tester
```

this likely means that React is trying to render a component with no `NODE_ENV` set. This has been observed to happen when running the site-builder with `pnpm start` with no `NODE_ENV` set, eg when running `pnpm start`.
