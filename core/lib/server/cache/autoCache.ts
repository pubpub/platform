/**
 * **✨ autoCache**
 *
 * Automagically caches and properly tags the result of a `kysely` query, scoped to a community!
 *
 * You can either pass a complete Kysely query excluding the final execute call, or a(n async)
 * function that returns a query builder as an object `{ qb: Q }`.
 *
 * See {@link autoRevalidate} for the sibling function that automatically revalidates the cache on
 * mutations.
 *
 * **Options**
 *
 * These are in addition to the same options for {@link memoize}
 *
 * **⚠️ WARNING**
 *
 * Only works in a `communitySlug` context. If you are not in a community context, so when calling this
 * from a requests originating from `/c/[communitySlug]` or `/api/v0/c/[communitySlug]`.
 *
 * If you are calling `autoCache` from outside such a context, you WILL NEED to pass the `communitySlug`
 * option to `autoCache` to make sure the cache is tagged properly.
 *
 * `autoCache` automatically retrieves the communitySlug from a header/cookie using {@link getCommunitySlug},
 * which in turn uses the `communitySlug` cookie set by middleware, which only works when in a `communitySlug` context.
 *
 * **Usage**
 *
 * _Direct usage_
 *
 * The most obvious useage is simply immediately passing the query you want to cache to `autoCache`.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const getUsersWithMemberships = autoCache(
 * 	db.selectFrom("users").select((eb) => [
 * 		"id",
 * 		"firstName",
 * 		"lastName",
 * 		"avatar",
 * 		jsonObjectAgg(
 * 			eb.selectFrom("members").selectAll().whereRef("members.user_id", "=", "users.id")
 * 		)
 * 			.where("community_id", "=", communityId)
 * 			.as("memberships"),
 * 	])
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * This returns an object with all the `execute` methods, as well as the querybuilder itself on the
 * `qb` property, should you want to extend or modify the query further.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const cachedResult = await getUsersWithMemberships.execute();
 * ```
 *
 * This will cache the query _and_ tag it properly!
 *
 * The tagging strategy is very simple: it tags every table mentioned in the query with the
 * community slug.
 *
 * For the query above, it tag the result with `community-users_${communitySlug}`,
 * `community-members_${communitySlug}`, `community-all-${communitySlug}`, and `all`.
 *
 * This works with almost any query, even recursive ones or CTEs.
 *
 * *Modifying the query*
 *
 * As mentioned above, the query builder is available on the `qb` property of the result object, so
 * you could do something like this:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const getAllUsers = autoCache(db.selectFrom("users").selectAll());
 *
 * const firstUserWithMembership = autoCache(
 * 	getAllUsers.qb.clearSelect().select((eb) => [
 * 		"id",
 *
 * 		"firstName",
 * 		"lastName",
 * 		"avatar",
 * 		jsonObjectAgg(
 * 			eb.selectFrom("members").selectAll().whereRef("members.user_id", "=", "users.id")
 * 		)
 * 			.where("community_id", "=", "s")
 * 			.as("memberships"),
 * 	])
 * ).executeTakeFirstOrThrow();
 * ```
 *
 * **NOTE**
 *
 * Only calling the `execute` functions returned from `autoCache` will actually cache the query! The
 * `qb` property is just a reference to the querybuilder you passed in, and will not cache the query
 * if you call `execute` on it.
 *
 * As you can see above, you will need to wrap the querybuilder in `autoCache` again to cache the
 * new query.
 *
 *
 * **How it works**
 *
 * Roughly, `autoCache` works by
 *
 * 1. Compiling the query to get the SQL and the parameters
 * 2. Finding all tables mentioned in the query
 * 3. Creating a cache key from the SQL, the parameters, and the tables
 * 4. Tagging the cache with the community slug and the tables
 * 5. Caching the result using {@link memoize}
