Digital interventions, which take advantage of advanced technologies and the wide reach of the internet, have emerged as important tools for disseminating accurate information, countering false narratives, and fostering critical thinking among the public (e.g. Horta Ribeiro et al., 2023; Katsaros et al., 2024; Kiili et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2024; Matias, 2019). One type of novel application in the field of digital counter-misinformation campaigns is the online, gamified version of inoculation interventions originally developed in social psychology (McGuire, 1961). Analogous to its medical counterpart, an inoculation involves exposing individuals to a diluted form of misinformation (e.g. van der Linden, 2023). The goal of inoculation interventions is to foster cognitive resistance to misinformation by equipping individuals with the skills to critically evaluate and question the veracity of information they encounter online. However, to date, inoculation interventions have almost exclusively been conducted in populations from continental Europe, the United Kingdom, and North America (Basol et al., 2020; Roozenbeek et al., 2022). In contrast to the results of studies conducted in Western contexts, Harjani and colleagues (2023) found no evidence for the effectiveness of an adapted version of a commonly used inoculation game. The present reflection article aims to expand on the explanations of Harjani et al. (2023) for why the inoculation game failed to show any effects in a large sample of Indian participants. In doing so, we focus on a practical solution via Intervention Mapping and a theoretical model that can explain differences in intervention effectiveness across cultures, specifically cultures with high and low literacy rates (Ghai, 2021)."}]},{"type":"heading","attrs":{"level":1,"id":"summary-of-harjani-et-al.s-study","class":null},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Summary of Harjani et al.’s Study"}]},{"type":"paragraph","attrs":{"id":"ndrtehrwaq6","class":null},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"The concept of inoculation theory, originally from immunology, has been adapted to digital interventions to combat misinformation.

As the authors themselves acknowledge, it is likely that the “game-based intervention was conducted on participants with minimal experience with operating digital devices” (Harjani et al., 2023, pp. 10-11): In the rural areas where the study was conducted, it is estimated that there are 25 digitally literate households for every 100 (Mothkoor & Mumtaz, 2021)."}]},{"type":"paragraph","attrs":{"id":"ngtnsvxvvr1","class":null},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Studies on misinformation trying to reach vulnerable populations with low digital literacy are faced with the limitation of how to reach these populations.

Another sampling approach is to disseminate online surveys through advertisements on social media (Athey et al., 2023; Garg and Yadav, 2022; Iyengar et al., 2022; Offer-Westort et al., 2024; Porter & Wood, 2021;). For example, Grag & Yadav (2022) reached a large sample of respondents in Uttar Pradesh through Facebook ads and found a significant effect of an inoculation intervention. However, 83% of the sample reached were college graduates, who make up 5% of the general population in the region. Another issue of ad recruitment relates to the use of English in countries where English is not widely spoken in rural areas (Brown, 2005; Translators without Borders, 2019), or where misinformation is spread through local languages (Saxena & John, 2021). A third approach is to sample participants through popular direct messaging apps (Bowles et al., 2020; Bowles et al., 2023; Gavin et al., 2022).

Indeed, digital tools and recruitment methods may not be the sole barrier to overcome; testing the offline success of successful online strategies against misinformation, without any digital support has mostly yielded null results. Experiments conducted in India and Pakistan using printed surveys, and occasionally with minimal audio-visual support, reported either no effect of the misinformation intervention studied (Badrinathan, 2021; Guess et al., 2020), or an effect that was largely driven by participants with higher digital literacy (Ali & Qazi, 2023). Indeed, this incomplete review suggests a particular pattern: The greater the distance from typical online samples, the less likely it is that the misinformation intervention designed to work online will be effective. Of course, there are a few notable exceptions, each with its own peculiarities. (Amar et al., 2024; Badrinathan et al., 2024). An example is the study by Badrinathan et al. (2024), which successfully reduced support for vigilantism in India and Pakistan.

In other words, beyond digital boundaries, there are other cultural and social boundaries that compromise the effectiveness of interventions when translating them into another context (Dahdouh-Guebas et al., 2003). One instance of cultural barriers may be that examples used in the intervention originating from the first culture may not apply to the experiences of individuals from the second culture. This perspective may help to explain the gap between the current findings and the effectiveness of the intervention in other countries or even in more urbanized areas of India.

Together with his collaborator Alexander Luria, he focused on how the internalization of cultural tools transforms the relationship between humans and their environment. According to Vygotsky (1934/2012), humans store information in the form of signs. In general, a sign is “a wholistic unit containing an image composed of sensory attributes as one of its parts, and an aspect of the external world as another part, or another image that is associated with that first image” (Toomela, 2020a, p. 155)."}]},{"type":"paragraph","attrs":{"id":"ncaewaby4gc","class":null},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"There are two types of signs according to this perspective.

Secondly, there are linguistic signs. In this case, a verbal signifier, such as a spoken word (e.g., “tree”), is connected to the mental image which is, in turn, still related to the external world. The link between the verbal signifier and the tree in the real world is thus indirect. Contrasting to natural signs, linguistic signs can be brought in different contexts than their referents.

Cultural neuropsychologist Aaro Toomela (2020a, 2020b) proposed that linguistic signs allow humans to make sense of their environment in different ways. Verbally, the same reality can be described in different or even conflicting ways. By resolving these conflicts, humans can become aware that not all aspects of the world are directly available to the senses. Importantly, some types of knowledge can only be arrived at based on signs with a certain structure. For example, the existence of atoms and the evolution of species cannot be seen, heard, or touched directly, but their existence can be conjectured and tested experimentally in indirect ways.

This includes past and future scenarios, potentially even over long stretches of time and space, as well as fictional stories and myths. However, all knowledge at this stage, even in reference to apparently non-sensory phenomena, such as religious ideas, is understood in concrete, everyday terms (e.g., \"Natural phenomena are controlled by spirits with human-like qualities\"). In a similar vein, an understanding of mental processes of both other people and oneself can start to develop at this stage, but these are also understood in a concrete sense. For example, \"knowing\" is understood as \"having seen it with my own eyes.\" Due to the possibilities to describe and conceptualize current and future situations, everyday concepts are sufficient for developing agriculture and complex societies.

At the stage of logical concepts, thought can become increasingly abstract and it becomes possible to reliably establish and justify knowledge about aspects of the world that are not available to the senses. With the possibility of describing language with language it also becomes possible to reflect on thoughts, beliefs, and feelings as abstract mental processes. Justifications of beliefs at this stage can go beyond statements of direct observation, considering more indirect observations.

For example, Luria (1976) presented the farmers with syllogisms such as the following: “Cotton can grow only where it is hot and dry. In England it is cold and damp. Can cotton grow there?” (p. 108). One of the farmers responded as follows: “I don’t know. [...]. I’ve only been in the Kashgar country; I don’t know beyond that” (p. 108). The participants of the education programs, in contrast, had little difficulties solving such syllogisms, i.e., to solve problems intra-linguistically. More recently, Toomela et al.

For this reason, researchers have tried to strike a balance between preserving the original form of the treatment and making it more accessible to understudied populations where the treatment has not yet been tested. The idea behind these changes is that “adaptation happens” regardless of careful controls, and that it is better to monitor and manage these changes than to allow them to implicitly and potentially negatively affect the outcome (Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016). A typical example of unmonitored adaptation is to retain those elements of the intervention that seem most appealing (e.g., the original structure of the intervention) and to change those elements that are more feasible to change (e.g., translation of the materials). Such decisions may result in reduced adherence or duration of effect, especially if the adaptations are not based on input from the community being studied.

Evidence on how to conduct this process relies heavily on existing applications, and there is no single guideline (Escoffery et al., 2019).

One example is the adaptation process of the inoculation game “Cranky Uncle.” Originally developed for a U.S. audience, the intervention underwent conspicuous modifications to its design and materials for adaptation to East African countries (Hopkins et al., 2023). These changes included a different representation of healthcare workers, localization of expressions and cultural references, and the incorporation of fact-based explanations alongside the original game’s logic-based explanations. Values and cultural references also play a role. For instance, appeals to the common good or trust in authorities might be perceived as untrustworthy in countries with strong authoritarian governments. Going back to the above-mentioned digital boundaries, experimenters also need to take into account the level of accessibility of the intervention: For example, researchers have to assess the literacy levels of respondents to adapt the content accordingly (Card et al., 2011), or at least monitor them at the time of data acquisition (Ali & Qazi, 2023).

(2023) underscore the limitations and challenges of applying digital inoculation interventions against misinformation in less urbanized and literate populations. Their study, which focused on rural Indian participants, revealed no significant effects of the adapted inoculation game on misinformation resistance. The authors justifiably highlighted the critical role of both digital and cultural barriers in the effectiveness of such interventions. We have proposed incorporating a cultural-historical perspective into intervention design, as it can provide deeper insights into how stages of conceptual development influence the reception and efficacy of misinformation interventions. Furthermore, we have proposed the application of Intervention Mapping as a systematic method for tailoring interventions to specific cultural contexts. By combining theoretical insights from psychological development with practical guidance inspired by research on the adaptation of medical treatments, we hope to inspire the design of more culturally attuned strategies to fight misinformation. Specifically, researchers should carefully identify the specific characteristics of the population being tested to select and adapt interventions, both in terms of typical reasoning styles and relevant cultural components."}]},{"type":"paragraph","attrs":{"id":"n592juw152j","class":null},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"As is to be expected, our proposal comes with a few caveats. The cultural-historical perspective is an influential theory from the history of psychology. However, even though some of its tenets have seen a resurgence in recent decades, there is still much work to do in further developing these theories and subjecting them to experimental testing. In the same vein, given that these theories are still highly general and theoretical, drawing practical implications is not always straightforward and may require additional leaps of thought that should be tested at each step. Moreover, although Intervention Mapping may represent a promising direction to help guide adaptation of interventions, this field originated only recently and is continuously evolving. Therefore, our guidelines are accompanied by a series of caveats. First, deviations from the original protocols are inherently risky, as Harjani and colleagues also suggest: Some interventions may show greater effectiveness when they preserve their original form. With too much focus on cultural fitting, there is indeed a risk of adaptation “hyperactivity” that may reduce rather than increase the fit of the intervention (Evans et al., 2021). Second, adaptations can be burdensome: Strengthening an intervention may require an investment of resources that is not always possible. Last, the recency of theories such as Intervention Mapping and the cultural variability of different settings entails that there is a lack of uniform evidence about which adaptations are most effective. There is much to be learned about this process, but also several opportunities to put it to a test."}]},{"type":"paragraph","attrs":{"id":"n59aj51ymnj","class":null},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"As a final remark, we hasten to note that different ways exist to adapt an intervention to its context (i.e., target population, environment, and target outcome). In the present paper, we mainly focus on a top-down approach to the adaptation of inoculation interventions online, namely, starting from interventions that were already developed for a specific population and adapting these to another population. An alternative, bottom-up approach to develop an adaptive intervention is to create a contextualized, that is, population-specific, intervention in close cooperation with representatives of this specific population. In this case, the resulting intervention is not a practical adaptation of an existing intervention but implements the features of the underlying theory for the intervention (here e.g., inoculation theory), in accordance with feedback from the population of interest. While the former (adapting existing interventions) is usually more resource efficient, the latter (creating an intervention from scratch) has the potential for high effectiveness by a maximized fit between the intervention and the focused population. We also do not intend to imply that interventions for rural societies are merely simplified versions of Western approaches. However, interventions relying heavily on formal logic, which often require formal schooling, may be less effective in rural societies where access to such education is limited. Interventions designed for contexts where everyday concepts dominate should account for this, alongside other population characteristics. Future research should therefore be conducted combining theoretical insights from cultural-historical psychology and Intervention Mapping to empirically test the effectiveness of mis- and disinformation interventions in different cultural contexts. For example, one could imagine a study that first investigates the dominant method of thinking (i.e., everyday versus logical concepts) in two given populations and subsequently applies an inoculation intervention and an alternative intervention in both populations. If our theory proves to be correct, the inoculation intervention should prove to be more effective in the population where thinking with logical concepts is dominant compared to the population where thinking with everyday concepts is dominant. Similarly, the alternative intervention should be more effective in the population where thinking with everyday concepts is dominant. If our theory is proven correct, interventions can be further developed to specifically target different types of populations, thereby contributing to the global fight against mis- and disinformation."}]},{"type":"heading","attrs":{"level":1,"id":"references","class":null},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"References"}]},{"type":"paragraph","attrs":{"id":"nigmfrmi5r3","class":null},"content":[{"type":"text","text":"Alderson-Day, B. & Fernyhough, C.
