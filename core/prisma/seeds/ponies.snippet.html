	shown success in a different anatomical location, were unable to correctly anchor the implant in
	the complex biomechanical environment of the joint. The imperfect dimensional match, originating
	from the intrinsic variability of the 3D printing process, had a much bigger influence than in

<p id="niurqm9soa0">
	The current study aimed at evaluating a cell-laden and a cell-free version of an osteochondral

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p id="n1xnyftyfcs">
	Focal cartilage damage is a major challenge in human healthcare since it leads to an increased
	risk of developing early osteoarthritis <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Most of
	the available repair approaches are palliative with limited alleviation time, generating fibrous
	tissue with reduced mechanical strength <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. There
	are no effective treatments that can fully restore the anatomical structure and function of
	focal cartilage defects. This unmet clinical need drives the ongoing quest for regenerative
	medicine and tissue-engineering approaches for articular cartilage repair
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>.
</p>
<p id="no966l0acng">
	Many new promising technologies
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong> are currently being
	developed and tested with the aim of finding an implant that is effective in facilitating
	regeneration of cartilage. Given the difficulties associated with the fixation of chondral
	constructs in the joint
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, an alternative
	approach is the use of composite osteochondral constructs composed of distinct osteal and
	chondral compartments that can be surgically press-fitted into suitably prepared defects,
	thereby avoiding the risk of dislodgement <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>.
	However, the latter approach still faces many challenges, including design and optimization of
	the osteal compartment to act as an anchor for the overlying chondral compartment, production of
	a firm and durable connection between osteal and chondral compartment
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, and optimization of the composition and
	structure of the chondral compartment
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>.
</p>
<p id="ns9qhozuvxy">
	To address those challenges, biomaterials that hold the potential for facilitating
	osteoregeneration within the osteal compartment were recently developed and investigated. First,
	3D printed brushite-based scaffolds have been shown to be effective in promoting new bone growth
	after 6 months in an equine model that used the tuber coxae as implantation site
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. However, these materials are usually processed
	using aggressive acidic treatments, precluding the direct incorporation of cells and/or some
	types of polymer during the fabrication phase. Therefore, an apatite-based scaffold that could
	harden under physiological conditions into a calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) was
	developed. This material had been shown to be effective in a 7-month long
	<em>in vivo</em> study, upon implantation in a critical size defect in the tuber coxae of
	horses. That study was performed to compare two sophisticated architectures with constant and
	gradient pore size, respectively. The material was shown to facilitate excellent new bone
	formation, particularly when using the scaffold with constant pore size
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. This showed the potential for using such
	material as an osteal anchor of a tissue-engineered osteochondral graft.
</p>
<p id="np5lb0926r5">
	Another major challenge is the connection between the osteal and chondral compartments of the
	tissue-engineered osteochondral graft when using cell-friendly materials of strongly different
	mechanical characteristics. Recently, a technique for attaching the chondral compartment to the
	osteal compartment using melt electrowriting (MEW) was developed
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, in which MEW fibers of the chondral compartment
	were partially incorporated into the slowly setting apatite-based osteal compartment, thereby
	binding the two compartments together. This strategy allows both for optimizing the mechnical
	properties of the MEW-reinforced chondral compartment, and for integrating the chondral and
	osteal compartments.
</p>
<p id="njw42sosvot">
	Regarding the seeding of regeneration-competent cells within the chondral compartment, articular
	cartilage-derived progenitor cells have been recently identified and characterized in both
	humans and horses as a distinct cell population that has the potential for cartilage repair
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. This potential was
	further shown to be retained in combination with biomaterials
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, making this cell
	type a promising candidate for a comprehensive regenerative approach. Additionally, it was
	recently discovered that supplementation with BMP-9 during <em>in vitro</em> culture of ACPCs
	resulted in higher expression of gene-markers related with hyaline-like extracellular matrix
	production, compared to supplementation with transforming growth factor (TGF<math-inline

	>), a more commonly used growth factor in cartilage tissue engineering
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. This observation sparked interest in further
	investigation of the potential of BMP-9-stimulated ACPCs for cartilage repair <em>in vivo</em>.
</p>
<p id="ndprrq1v0g3">
	The current study aimed at evaluating an osteochondral composite scaffold for cartilage repair.
	These constructs were composed of a combination of a previously proven osteogenic CDHA 3D
	printed scaffold for the osteal compartment, onto which a chondral compartment composed by MEW
	micro-fibrous meshes is tightly anchored. For the chondral compartment, an experimental group in
	which the MEW structure was seeded with ACPCs that had been stimulated for 28 days with BMP-9
	before implantation <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, was compared with an implant
	featuring a non-filled, cell-free MEW cartilage scaffold as control. It was hypothesized that 1)
	the CDHA scaffold would show comparable performance in the horse when implanted in the
	subchondral bone as in the tuber coxae in terms of firmly anchoring in the surrounding tissue
	and inducing bone growth; 2) the novel interface would provide a lasting connection between the
	osteal and chondral compartments of osteochondral graft; and 3) the engineered chondral
	compartment of the osteochondral graft containing the stimulated ACPCs would outperform the
	cell-free structures in terms of <em>in vivo</em> cartilage matrix production (specifically,
	amount and density of type II collagen and GAGs, with resulting mechanical properties as close
	as possible to those of native, healthy cartilage).

	To process the data, the reconstruction of three-dimensional coordinates of each marker was
	automatically calculated by Q-Track software (Qtrack, Qualisys, Gothenburg, Sweden). Each marker
	was identified and labelled using an automated model (AIM model) and manual tracking. Raw data
	of the designated markers were exported to Matlab (version 2018a, Niantics, California) for
	further analysis using custom written scripts. For each stride, two symmetry parameters were
	calculated using the vertical displacement of the head and pelvis (tubera sacrale) markers. For
	each stride, the differences between the two vertical displacement minima of the head
	(MinDiffhead) and pelvis (MinDiffpelvis) were calculated. Using the markers, limb-segments were
	formed and angles between these limb-segments were calculated. The difference between the
	maximal and minimal angle was defined as the range of motion (ROM) of a joint. For each
	timepoint, the mean value of all strides for each parameter was calculated.

	This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an engineered osteochondral composite scaffold that
	was fabricated by combining a proven osteogenic CDHA scaffold for the osteal compartment with a
	novel interface for the connection between the chondral and osteal compartments. For the
	chondral compartment, BMP-9 stimulated cell-laden and cell-free constructs were compared. The
	cell-laden constructs contained <em>in vitro</em> formed tissue that was rich in GAGs and type
	II collagen, obtained by seeding Articular Cartilage Progenitor Cells (ACPCs) and stimulating
	them with BMP-9 for 4 weeks prior to implantation. After implantation in an equine osteochondral
	defect for 6 months, there was poor chondral repair tissue in both the cell-laden and cell-free
	implants. The repair tissue was akin to fibrocartilage and was characterized by the presence of
	fibrous tissue with low content of GAGs and type II collagen and a degenerated surface. The CDHA
	scaffold had failed to act as an osteal anchor, as evidenced by the radiographical images
	showing misalignment and partial collapse of the CDHA construct, the presence of CDHA fragments
	within the defect and in the surrounding tissues, and a limited volume of newly formed calcified
	bone in the pores of the osteal anchor.

	In the quest for a method to achieve satisfactory and durable repair of articular cartilage,
	several osteochondral grafts that incorporate cells and that were manipulated to optimize
	biochemical and biomechanical properties, have been investigated in the past decades
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Articular Cartilage Progenitor Cells have become
	a promising cell source due to their ability to retain their chondrogenicity after their
	expansion for several passages <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Recently, growth
	factor BMP-9 was shown to be a potent stimulator of chondrogenic differentiation of this cell
	type <em>in vitro</em> <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. This warranted further
	investigations to evaluate the use of BMP-9 stimulated ACPCs for cartilage repair
	<em>in vivo</em>. Indeed, the cell-laden chondral compartment showed a high presence of
	neo-cartilage extracellular matrix production after pre-culture at the time of implantation, yet
	the average GAG content decreased approximately 6.5-fold during the
	<em>in vivo</em> implantation period. The GAG content of cell-laden constructs in fact decreased
	to the level of the cell-free constructs, suggesting loss or disintegration of the
	<em>in vitro</em> formed tissue. Which factor initiated this loss of <em>in vitro</em> formed
	tissue remains unclear. A previous study from
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong> demonstrated superior results in using ACPCs for
	cartilage repair in an equine model, in comparison with mesenchymal stem cells. However, due to
	the use of different materials and cell culture protocols, it is impossible to directly compare
	those results with the ones from the current study. Several factors might have been involved in
	the deterioration of the chondral compartment in this study, most prominently mechanical
	stresses due to the partial failure of the osteal basis and the resulting poor osteointegration
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>.
</p>
<p id="n7um4df2l9s">
	The nature of the osteal anchor is an important factor when developing tissue-engineered
	osteochondral implants. Much work has been done on the development of several types of bone
	grafts and many of these are routinely used in clinical settings
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, so of the various elements of an osteochondral
	implant, the bone part is seemingly the least difficult one. However, the relationship between
	the osteal anchor and the quantity and quality of the repair tissue in the chondral compartment
	has been the subject of debate <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong> and it is still
	unclear what osteal anchor would form the best base for facilitating cartilage repair. The exact
	same bioceramic material tested in this long-term, orthotopic equine study, had previously been
	shown to successfully guide osteoregeneration in the same species, when implanted in the tuber
	coxae, an anatomical locus less subject to intense mechanical loads
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Additionally, this previous study also focused
	on comparing different pore architecture within the 3D printed bone scaffolds. The scaffold
	architecture that led to the highest rate of new bone formation, consisting of a constant pore
	size across the sample, was selected for the present study, with the goal of maximizing neo-bone
	repair <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. However, there are two major differences
	with the use of the material in the current study. First, in the previous study the material was
	implanted in the tuber coxae, which is an orthotopic area but not representative of the
	intra-articular environment. Second, in the former study the implant was surrounded by a
	cylindrical case made of PCL that served to prevent bone ingrowth from the sides. Without such a
	shell of the mechanically deformable PCL in the current study, the surgeon encountered
	difficulties during the surgical placement of the implants, provoked by the non-resilience and
	brittleness of the CaP-based material, combined with some deviation from an ideal cylindrical
	shape of the CDHA implant. This resulted in fragments breaking off from the bioceramic osteal
	anchor. In fact, although inadvertently and as a side-effect, this problem of fragment formation
	was avoided in the former study when using PCL to encase. Polycaprolactone is deformable
	material, and the encasing will have facilitated the sliding of the ceramic implant into the
	defect. The duration of both studies was not identical (7 months in the earlier study, 6 months
	in the current), which makes direct comparisons between the two impossible. However, there were
	clear histological differences with many more multifocal to coalescing inflammatory reactions in
	both cell-laden and cell-free implants in the current study, compared to the earlier study, in
	which there were very few inflammatory cells visible. This difference is likely due to the
	chronic irritation caused by fragments of material and to instability resulting from the
	imperfect fit of scaffold within the defect in the current study.

<p id="nhuwhoi2c5m">
	Some scaffolds from the current study collapsed and showed misalignment of the CDHA structure
	within the defect, with slightly enlarged defect size after an implantation for 6 months (as
	evident from the micro-CT analysis). Bone resorption around the implant was found both in the
	groups with cell-laden and with cell-free chondral compartment, which infer the effect from the
	osteal anchor rather than from the variable within chondral compartment. The circumstances
	described above likely resulted in failure to place the implant in a real press-fit fashion and
	hence, in the creation of (micro)movement, leading to increasing instability under repetitive
	loading together with possible material degradation over time and ensuing osteolysis, as seen
	earlier <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>.
	Additionally, the gap between the implant and surrounding native tissue due to the imperfect fit
	may have allowed for the intrusion of synovial fluid. Contact of synovial fluid with subchondral
	bone has been shown to induce osteolysis <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. In the
	few scaffolds that remained in place, the volume of mineralized bone formation was also lower
	than what was found in the earlier study, both in cell-laden and cell-free treatments. This is
	potentially due to the higher and cyclical loads experienced in the articulating joint compared
	to the tuber coxae. Overall, it was not possible to determine a single cause for the failure of
	the CDHA scaffolds to act as the anchor of the engineered osteochondral implant, and it is
	likely that the limited osteointegration is due to a combination of misalignment after surgery,
	mechanical failure under cyclic loading, and synovial fluid infiltration.
</p>
<p id="noo3otiqk3g">
	In earlier studies
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong> similar observations
	were made. In those studies, fibrous repair tissue was seen in the chondral compartment,
	together with osteolysis and formation of a fibrous interface surrounding the osteal anchor when
	tissue-engineered osteochondral grafts were implanted in a load-bearing area for a 12-month
	long-term study. It was hypothesized that osteolysis and the fibrous layer surrounding the
	osteal anchor led to instability that might have caused the degradation of the newly formed
	cartilage-like repair tissue observed at the early of the experiment. Stability of the
	osteochondral graft might be affected by multiple parameters including the alignment of an
	osteal compartment within the defect and the properties of the materials being used
	<strong
		>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node
		'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong
	>, as these might affect stability of the overlying chondral compartment. In the current study,
	misalignment and partial collapse of the osteal part of the construct might also be at the basis
	of the protrusion of the chondral compartment of some cell-laden constructs and the inconsistent
	position of the chondral graft with respect to the surrounding native tissue in both groups.
	These conditions may have led to an abnormal load distribution, possibly inducing inferior
	biomechanical properties <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. It is thus clear that
	the imperfect implantation had severe repercussions and can be considered a major factor that
	affected the chondral compartment and hence the outcome of the study. This effect was noticeable
	to the extent that drawing any conclusions about the effect of BMP-9 seeded ACPCs, which was the
	principal variable that was to be tested in the study, is not possible. Also, no conclusion
	could be reached about the interface between the osteal and chondral compartments that was used
	since delocalized MEW-mesh structures were observed in some scaffolds from both groups. This
	might be due to misalignments of the osteal compartment as discussed above, to shear forces
	during loading, or a combination of both.

<p id="n334o0cod7i">
	During the <em>in vivo</em> post-operative monitoring of the animals, the clinical signs were
	very mild and far from alarming, except for the single pony that developed severe lameness.
	Clinical examinations were performed routinely by experienced veterinary specialists, however,
	assessment of locomotion through visual observation alone is subjective and known to have poor
	repeatability, especially in mild cases. This is partly due to the inability of human visual
	perception to properly distinguish, notice, and quantify differences in locomotion at high
	resolution <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Therefore, quantitative gait analysis
	was employed as an objective and non-invasive assessment. The gait analysis data did not show
	many differences with respect to baseline. This may to a certain extent have been related to
	methodological factors. During the assessment, ponies were put on a treadmill and they were
	imposed the same belt velocity during both measurements. Therefore, the subjects were forced to
	trot at the same velocity, ensuring that stride length needed to be maintained. This might be
	the reason why there were no differences between timepoints for maximal protraction and
	retraction (the limb parameters). However, pelvis pitch range of motion (ROM) decreased for all
	subjects with almost 20% over time. This pattern is often seen in case of dysfunction of the
	back. The finding may thus be related to earlier observations that bilateral hindlimb lameness
	may induce back problems in horses
	<strong
		>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node
		'citation'!</strong
	>. Toe dragging of the lame limb, in which the hoof is lifted less high off the ground, is
	another sign of pain <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Nevertheless, the overall
	impact of the bilateral lesions in the stifle joints was low, as evidenced by the fact that
	there was no sign of load redistribution from the hind to the front limbs. If that had been the
	case, the subjects would have compensated by displacing their center of mass more to the front,
	resulting in more negative angles for forelimb fetlock extension, as fetlock hyper extension
	correlates with peak ground reaction force (GRFPeak)
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, where less negative angles indicate a lowered
	GRFpeak. In fact, only the fetlock angles of the forelimb ipsilateral to cell-laden construct
	changed, becoming less negative, hence indicating unloading rather than additional loading
	(lower GRFpeak). The reason for this is not clear.
</p>
<p id="nn8y5p7vw8j">
	It can be concluded that even seemingly minor modifications of a successful implant may have
	grave consequences and extrapolation is dangerous in the complex <em>in vivo</em> situation. In
	this case, the failure of the osteal compartment of the construct, the use of which seemed
	well-backed by solid <em>in vivo</em> data, did not permit drawing conclusions about the
	original hypotheses. Given the relatively frequently occurring, rather disappointing results of
	<em>in vivo</em> orthotopic testing of promising techniques for joint repair, it may be wise to
	put more emphasis on performing pilot experiments before embarking on a full-scale
	<em>in vivo</em> study in a large animal experiment
	<strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Functional joint repair remains a huge challenge
	that has not been addressed to some satisfying extent during the last decades, despite many
	promising approaches. It is likely that the quest for a real solution will go on for some time
	by trial and error with more errors to come. Those errors are inevitable and need to be made but
	they should take the least possible toll on experimental animals.

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p id="nki3arops7h">
	This study presented the results from the evaluation of a cell-laden and cell-free versions of
	an osteochondral implant for cartilage repair in a challenging <em>in vivo</em> large animal
	model. The osteal anchor of this osteochondral implant, composed of a bioceramic material that
	had previously been proven to facilitate mineralized new bone formation in the same species,
	failed to perform as an effective fixation with sufficient stabilization for both cell-laden and
	cell-free osteochondral implants. This insufficient fixation was evidenced by the extensive
	osteolysis, the collapse and misalignment of the osteal anchor, and the limited volume of newly
	formed bone. The failure of the bone anchor hindered the evaluation of the two versions of the
	chondral compartment for cartilage repair. The study shows that, even after an equivalent
	ceramic bone component had shown very satisfactory results in the same species, minor
	differences in the implant and a change in testing condition proved to be enough to lead to
	completely different results, in this case precluding drawing conclusions about the effect of
	the principal variable. This outcome stresses the need of carrying out <em>in vivo</em> pilot
	studies under exactly the same conditions before moving into a larger <em>in vivo</em> study.

		<em>Gait analysis: symmetry parameters.</em> Pelvis roll and yaw joint angles (A,B) showed
		no significant differences between baseline and 6 months after implantation and neither did
		the kinematic hind limb parameters (C, D, E) between baseline and 6 months after induction.
		Limb height of the hind limbs (F) decreased for both hindlimbs, but only significantly for
		the cell free group, though there was no difference in limb height between cell-laden and
		cell-free groups at 6 months after implementation.
