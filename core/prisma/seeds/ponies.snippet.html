This precluded drawing firm conclusions about the potential for <em>in vivo</em> cartilage repair of the chondral compartment, consisting of bone morphogenetic protein-9 (BMP-9) stimulated progenitor cells. Collapse occurred because bone regeneration competent materials, which had shown success in a different anatomical location, were unable to correctly anchor the implant in the complex biomechanical environment of the joint. The imperfect dimensional match, originating from the intrinsic variability of the 3D printing process, had a much bigger influence than in previous studies. When combined with the brittle nature of the material, the implant was unable to withstand the complex loading of the knee joint.</p><h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1><p id="niurqm9soa0">The current study aimed at evaluating a cell-laden and a cell-free version of an osteochondral composite scaffold for cartilage repair that consisted of an <em>in vivo</em> proven osteogenic bone scaffold for the osteal compartment and made use of a novel interface for the connection of the chondral and osteal compartments.</p><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1><p id="n1xnyftyfcs">Focal cartilage damage is a major challenge in human healthcare since it leads to an increased risk of developing early osteoarthritis <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Most of the available repair approaches are palliative with limited alleviation time, generating fibrous tissue with reduced mechanical strength <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. There are no effective treatments that can fully restore the anatomical structure and function of focal cartilage defects. This unmet clinical need drives the ongoing quest for regenerative medicine and tissue-engineering approaches for articular cartilage repair <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>.</p><p id="no966l0acng">Many new promising technologies <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong> are currently being developed and tested with the aim of finding an implant that is effective in facilitating regeneration of cartilage. Given the difficulties associated with the fixation of chondral constructs in the joint <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, an alternative approach is the use of composite osteochondral constructs composed of distinct osteal and chondral compartments that can be surgically press-fitted into suitably prepared defects, thereby avoiding the risk of dislodgement <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. However, the latter approach still faces many challenges, including design and optimization of the osteal compartment to act as an anchor for the overlying chondral compartment, production of a firm and durable connection between osteal and chondral compartment <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, and optimization of the composition and structure of the chondral compartment <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>.</p><p id="ns9qhozuvxy">To address those challenges, biomaterials that hold the potential for facilitating osteoregeneration within the osteal compartment were recently developed and investigated. First, 3D printed brushite-based scaffolds have been shown to be effective in promoting new bone growth after 6 months in an equine model that used the tuber coxae as implantation site <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. However, these materials are usually processed using aggressive acidic treatments, precluding the direct incorporation of cells and/or some types of polymer during the fabrication phase. Therefore, an apatite-based scaffold that could harden under physiological conditions into a calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) was developed. This material had been shown to be effective in a 7-month long <em>in vivo</em> study, upon implantation in a critical size defect in the tuber coxae of horses. That study was performed to compare two sophisticated architectures with constant and gradient pore size, respectively. The material was shown to facilitate excellent new bone formation, particularly when using the scaffold with constant pore size <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. This showed the potential for using such material as an osteal anchor of a tissue-engineered osteochondral graft.</p><p id="np5lb0926r5">Another major challenge is the connection between the osteal and chondral compartments of the tissue-engineered osteochondral graft when using cell-friendly materials of strongly different mechanical characteristics. Recently, a technique for attaching the chondral compartment to the osteal compartment using melt electrowriting (MEW) was developed <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, in which MEW fibers of the chondral compartment were partially incorporated into the slowly setting apatite-based osteal compartment, thereby binding the two compartments together. This strategy allows both for optimizing the mechnical properties of the MEW-reinforced chondral compartment, and for integrating the chondral and osteal compartments.</p><p id="njw42sosvot">Regarding the seeding of regeneration-competent cells within the chondral compartment, articular cartilage-derived progenitor cells have been recently identified and characterized in both humans and horses as a distinct cell population that has the potential for cartilage repair <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. This potential was further shown to be retained in combination with biomaterials <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, making this cell type a promising candidate for a comprehensive regenerative approach. Additionally, it was recently discovered that supplementation with BMP-9 during <em>in vitro</em> culture of ACPCs resulted in higher expression of gene-markers related with hyaline-like extracellular matrix production, compared to supplementation with transforming growth factor (TGF<math-inline classname="math-inline"><span class="katex"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>β</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\beta</annotation></semantics></math></span></math-inline>), a more commonly used growth factor in cartilage tissue engineering <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. This observation sparked interest in further investigation of the potential of BMP-9-stimulated ACPCs for cartilage repair <em>in vivo</em>.</p><p id="ndprrq1v0g3">The current study aimed at evaluating an osteochondral composite scaffold for cartilage repair. These constructs were composed of a combination of a previously proven osteogenic CDHA 3D printed scaffold for the osteal compartment, onto which a chondral compartment composed by MEW micro-fibrous meshes is tightly anchored. For the chondral compartment, an experimental group in which the MEW structure was seeded with ACPCs that had been stimulated for 28 days with BMP-9 before implantation <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, was compared with an implant featuring a non-filled, cell-free MEW cartilage scaffold as control. It was hypothesized that 1) the CDHA scaffold would show comparable performance in the horse when implanted in the subchondral bone as in the tuber coxae in terms of firmly anchoring in the surrounding tissue and inducing bone growth; 2) the novel interface would provide a lasting connection between the osteal and chondral compartments of osteochondral graft; and 3) the engineered chondral compartment of the osteochondral graft containing the stimulated ACPCs would outperform the cell-free structures in terms of <em>in vivo</em> cartilage matrix production (specifically, amount and density of type II collagen and GAGs, with resulting mechanical properties as close as possible to those of native, healthy cartilage).</p><h1 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h1><h2 id="experimental-design">Experimental design</h2><p id="nlxgsp26igz">To assess the performance of integrated 3D printed osteochondral grafts that contained a cell-laden or a cell-free chondral compartment, the constructs were orthotopically implanted in a large animal model.

Raw data of the designated markers were exported to Matlab (version 2018a, Niantics, California) for further analysis using custom written scripts.

For each stride, the differences between the two vertical displacement minima of the head (MinDiffhead) and pelvis (MinDiffpelvis) were calculated. Using the markers, limb-segments were formed and angles between these limb-segments were calculated.

There were multifocal coalescing spots of inflammatory reaction characterized by macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells (Supplementary Figure <a href="#fig:sup5">16</a>, Supplementary Figure <a href="#fig:sup6">17</a>, Supplementary Figure <a href="#fig:sup7">18</a>).</p><figure id="fig:figure11"><img id="fig:figure11" alt="" src="https://assets.pubpub.org/a7aeelcb/01615913756780.jpg" data-link-to="" data-width="50" data-align="full" data-node-type="image"><figcaption><em>Representative histological images from the center part of cell-laden and cell-free structures after implantation for 6 months.</em> Safranin-O/fast green (red color = positive) (A, E); Collagen type II (brown color = positive) (B, F); Picrosirius-red (C, G); collagen type I (brown color = positive) (D, H) of cell-laden (A-D) and cell-free structures (Scale bar = 1<em>mm</em>).</figcaption></figure><h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1><p id="nqfg73sp485">This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an engineered osteochondral composite scaffold that was fabricated by combining a proven osteogenic CDHA scaffold for the osteal compartment with a novel interface for the connection between the chondral and osteal compartments. For the chondral compartment, BMP-9 stimulated cell-laden and cell-free constructs were compared. The cell-laden constructs contained <em>in vitro</em> formed tissue that was rich in GAGs and type II collagen, obtained by seeding Articular Cartilage Progenitor Cells (ACPCs) and stimulating them with BMP-9 for 4 weeks prior to implantation. After implantation in an equine osteochondral defect for 6 months, there was poor chondral repair tissue in both the cell-laden and cell-free implants. The repair tissue was akin to fibrocartilage and was characterized by the presence of fibrous tissue with low content of GAGs and type II collagen and a degenerated surface. The CDHA scaffold had failed to act as an osteal anchor, as evidenced by the radiographical images showing misalignment and partial collapse of the CDHA construct, the presence of CDHA fragments within the defect and in the surrounding tissues, and a limited volume of newly formed calcified bone in the pores of the osteal anchor.</p><p id="nta8ebcde01">In the quest for a method to achieve satisfactory and durable repair of articular cartilage, several osteochondral grafts that incorporate cells and that were manipulated to optimize biochemical and biomechanical properties, have been investigated in the past decades <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Articular Cartilage Progenitor Cells have become a promising cell source due to their ability to retain their chondrogenicity after their expansion for several passages <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Recently, growth factor BMP-9 was shown to be a potent stimulator of chondrogenic differentiation of this cell type <em>in vitro</em> <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. This warranted further investigations to evaluate the use of BMP-9 stimulated ACPCs for cartilage repair <em>in vivo</em>. Indeed, the cell-laden chondral compartment showed a high presence of neo-cartilage extracellular matrix production after pre-culture at the time of implantation, yet the average GAG content decreased approximately 6.5-fold during the <em>in vivo</em> implantation period. The GAG content of cell-laden constructs in fact decreased to the level of the cell-free constructs, suggesting loss or disintegration of the <em>in vitro</em> formed tissue. Which factor initiated this loss of <em>in vitro</em> formed tissue remains unclear. A previous study from <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong> demonstrated superior results in using ACPCs for cartilage repair in an equine model, in comparison with mesenchymal stem cells. However, due to the use of different materials and cell culture protocols, it is impossible to directly compare those results with the ones from the current study. Several factors might have been involved in the deterioration of the chondral compartment in this study, most prominently mechanical stresses due to the partial failure of the osteal basis and the resulting poor osteointegration <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>.</p><p id="n7um4df2l9s">The nature of the osteal anchor is an important factor when developing tissue-engineered osteochondral implants. Much work has been done on the development of several types of bone grafts and many of these are routinely used in clinical settings <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, so of the various elements of an osteochondral implant, the bone part is seemingly the least difficult one. However, the relationship between the osteal anchor and the quantity and quality of the repair tissue in the chondral compartment has been the subject of debate <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong> and it is still unclear what osteal anchor would form the best base for facilitating cartilage repair. The exact same bioceramic material tested in this long-term, orthotopic equine study, had previously been shown to successfully guide osteoregeneration in the same species, when implanted in the tuber coxae, an anatomical locus less subject to intense mechanical loads <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Additionally, this previous study also focused on comparing different pore architecture within the 3D printed bone scaffolds. The scaffold architecture that led to the highest rate of new bone formation, consisting of a constant pore size across the sample, was selected for the present study, with the goal of maximizing neo-bone repair <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. However, there are two major differences with the use of the material in the current study. First, in the previous study the material was implanted in the tuber coxae, which is an orthotopic area but not representative of the intra-articular environment. Second, in the former study the implant was surrounded by a cylindrical case made of PCL that served to prevent bone ingrowth from the sides. Without such a shell of the mechanically deformable PCL in the current study, the surgeon encountered difficulties during the surgical placement of the implants, provoked by the non-resilience and brittleness of the CaP-based material, combined with some deviation from an ideal cylindrical shape of the CDHA implant. This resulted in fragments breaking off from the bioceramic osteal anchor. In fact, although inadvertently and as a side-effect, this problem of fragment formation was avoided in the former study when using PCL to encase. Polycaprolactone is deformable material, and the encasing will have facilitated the sliding of the ceramic implant into the defect. The duration of both studies was not identical (7 months in the earlier study, 6 months in the current), which makes direct comparisons between the two impossible. However, there were clear histological differences with many more multifocal to coalescing inflammatory reactions in both cell-laden and cell-free implants in the current study, compared to the earlier study, in which there were very few inflammatory cells visible. This difference is likely due to the chronic irritation caused by fragments of material and to instability resulting from the imperfect fit of scaffold within the defect in the current study.</p><p id="nhuwhoi2c5m">Some scaffolds from the current study collapsed and showed misalignment of the CDHA structure within the defect, with slightly enlarged defect size after an implantation for 6 months (as evident from the micro-CT analysis). Bone resorption around the implant was found both in the groups with cell-laden and with cell-free chondral compartment, which infer the effect from the osteal anchor rather than from the variable within chondral compartment. The circumstances described above likely resulted in failure to place the implant in a real press-fit fashion and hence, in the creation of (micro)movement, leading to increasing instability under repetitive loading together with possible material degradation over time and ensuing osteolysis, as seen earlier <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Additionally, the gap between the implant and surrounding native tissue due to the imperfect fit may have allowed for the intrusion of synovial fluid. Contact of synovial fluid with subchondral bone has been shown to induce osteolysis <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. In the few scaffolds that remained in place, the volume of mineralized bone formation was also lower than what was found in the earlier study, both in cell-laden and cell-free treatments. This is potentially due to the higher and cyclical loads experienced in the articulating joint compared to the tuber coxae. Overall, it was not possible to determine a single cause for the failure of the CDHA scaffolds to act as the anchor of the engineered osteochondral implant, and it is likely that the limited osteointegration is due to a combination of misalignment after surgery, mechanical failure under cyclic loading, and synovial fluid infiltration.</p><p id="noo3otiqk3g">In earlier studies <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong> similar observations were made. In those studies, fibrous repair tissue was seen in the chondral compartment, together with osteolysis and formation of a fibrous interface surrounding the osteal anchor when tissue-engineered osteochondral grafts were implanted in a load-bearing area for a 12-month long-term study. It was hypothesized that osteolysis and the fibrous layer surrounding the osteal anchor led to instability that might have caused the degradation of the newly formed cartilage-like repair tissue observed at the early of the experiment. Stability of the osteochondral graft might be affected by multiple parameters including the alignment of an osteal compartment within the defect and the properties of the materials being used <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, as these might affect stability of the overlying chondral compartment. In the current study, misalignment and partial collapse of the osteal part of the construct might also be at the basis of the protrusion of the chondral compartment of some cell-laden constructs and the inconsistent position of the chondral graft with respect to the surrounding native tissue in both groups. These conditions may have led to an abnormal load distribution, possibly inducing inferior biomechanical properties <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. It is thus clear that the imperfect implantation had severe repercussions and can be considered a major factor that affected the chondral compartment and hence the outcome of the study. This effect was noticeable to the extent that drawing any conclusions about the effect of BMP-9 seeded ACPCs, which was the principal variable that was to be tested in the study, is not possible. Also, no conclusion could be reached about the interface between the osteal and chondral compartments that was used since delocalized MEW-mesh structures were observed in some scaffolds from both groups. This might be due to misalignments of the osteal compartment as discussed above, to shear forces during loading, or a combination of both.</p><p id="n334o0cod7i">During the <em>in vivo</em> post-operative monitoring of the animals, the clinical signs were very mild and far from alarming, except for the single pony that developed severe lameness. Clinical examinations were performed routinely by experienced veterinary specialists, however, assessment of locomotion through visual observation alone is subjective and known to have poor repeatability, especially in mild cases. This is partly due to the inability of human visual perception to properly distinguish, notice, and quantify differences in locomotion at high resolution <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Therefore, quantitative gait analysis was employed as an objective and non-invasive assessment. The gait analysis data did not show many differences with respect to baseline. This may to a certain extent have been related to methodological factors. During the assessment, ponies were put on a treadmill and they were imposed the same belt velocity during both measurements. Therefore, the subjects were forced to trot at the same velocity, ensuring that stride length needed to be maintained. This might be the reason why there were no differences between timepoints for maximal protraction and retraction (the limb parameters). However, pelvis pitch range of motion (ROM) decreased for all subjects with almost 20% over time. This pattern is often seen in case of dysfunction of the back. The finding may thus be related to earlier observations that bilateral hindlimb lameness may induce back problems in horses <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Toe dragging of the lame limb, in which the hoof is lifted less high off the ground, is another sign of pain <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Nevertheless, the overall impact of the bilateral lesions in the stifle joints was low, as evidenced by the fact that there was no sign of load redistribution from the hind to the front limbs. If that had been the case, the subjects would have compensated by displacing their center of mass more to the front, resulting in more negative angles for forelimb fetlock extension, as fetlock hyper extension correlates with peak ground reaction force (GRFPeak) <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>, where less negative angles indicate a lowered GRFpeak. In fact, only the fetlock angles of the forelimb ipsilateral to cell-laden construct changed, becoming less negative, hence indicating unloading rather than additional loading (lower GRFpeak). The reason for this is not clear.</p><p id="nn8y5p7vw8j">It can be concluded that even seemingly minor modifications of a successful implant may have grave consequences and extrapolation is dangerous in the complex <em>in vivo</em> situation. In this case, the failure of the osteal compartment of the construct, the use of which seemed well-backed by solid <em>in vivo</em> data, did not permit drawing conclusions about the original hypotheses. Given the relatively frequently occurring, rather disappointing results of <em>in vivo</em> orthotopic testing of promising techniques for joint repair, it may be wise to put more emphasis on performing pilot experiments before embarking on a full-scale <em>in vivo</em> study in a large animal experiment <strong>!unsupported node 'citation'!</strong>. Functional joint repair remains a huge challenge that has not been addressed to some satisfying extent during the last decades, despite many promising approaches. It is likely that the quest for a real solution will go on for some time by trial and error with more errors to come. Those errors are inevitable and need to be made but they should take the least possible toll on experimental animals.</p><h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p id="nki3arops7h">This study presented the results from the evaluation of a cell-laden and cell-free versions of an osteochondral implant for cartilage repair in a challenging <em>in vivo</em> large animal model. The osteal anchor of this osteochondral implant, composed of a bioceramic material that had previously been proven to facilitate mineralized new bone formation in the same species, failed to perform as an effective fixation with sufficient stabilization for both cell-laden and cell-free osteochondral implants. This insufficient fixation was evidenced by the extensive osteolysis, the collapse and misalignment of the osteal anchor, and the limited volume of newly formed bone. The failure of the bone anchor hindered the evaluation of the two versions of the chondral compartment for cartilage repair. The study shows that, even after an equivalent ceramic bone component had shown very satisfactory results in the same species, minor differences in the implant and a change in testing condition proved to be enough to lead to completely different results, in this case precluding drawing conclusions about the effect of the principal variable. This outcome stresses the need of carrying out <em>in vivo</em> pilot studies under exactly the same conditions before moving into a larger <em>in vivo</em> study.</p><h1 id="references">References</h1><p id="nronnfan6on">Abinzano, F., de Ruijter, M., Mensinga, A., Castilho, M., Khan, I., Levato, R., &amp; Malda, J.
