# Pub Relationships

In v6, we had Collections and Pubs, in addition to Connections. These allowed us to have parent-child relationships (Collections-Pubs) and arbitrary non-hierarchical, non-permission-granting relationships (Connections). The questions for v7 are:

- Given Pub Types, can we reconcile these two in relationships into a more simple UI/UX
- Do we need both relationship types?

## Permission cascading

## Performance considerations
